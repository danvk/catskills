My first visit to the Catskills! I trained up from the city, met up with Max in Poughkeepsie and we drove over to the Roaring Kill trailhead.

First we summited Sugarloaf

Then we set up a campsite somewhere downhill from Pecoy Notch. Looking at his map, Max was very insistent that there was a great campsite somewhere beyond this bog:

That ended with a very muddy Max. I still find this photo funny seven years later!

The next day we hiked up Twin

and then back down to the Jimmy Dolan notch and the road. I vaguely recall hitchhiking along Prediger Road to get back to our car at the other trailhead.

All in all a great trip. I'm very appreciative to Max for introducing me to hiking in the Catskills!
