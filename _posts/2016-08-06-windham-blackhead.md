Overnight hiking / camping with Max & Gabe. This track is reconstructed based on my photos. Some memories of this are struggling to start a campfire in damp conditions and meeting a happy trail runner at the top of one of the peaks.

We must have hiked just into Windhma and made camp at nightfall on the 5th.

It's unclear to me how we ended this hike; my last photo is near the top of Blackhead, which would be quite a ways from our car back at Windham.
