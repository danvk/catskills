This was another overnight camping trip with Max (we'd done another [in May]). This time our friend Gabe joined us. We took the train up from the city after work on Friday, borrowed Max's parents' car in Poughkeepsie, got some supplies and made our way to the Escarpment Trail near Windham High Peak. We must have arrived quite late. I remember hiking in just a little bit (it looks like a mile from the map) and making camp.

After breaking camp on day 2, we made our way up towards Windham High Peak.

It looks like it was very misty weather that morning. This may explain why, when I hiked Windham again [four years later], I had no recollection of the summit.

We continued along the Escarpment Trail towards Acra point. It looks like we lounged at the viewpoint near Burnt Knob and had lunch.

I'm not sure whether it was here or on Blackhead, but I distinctly remember seeing a trail runner who looked extremely fit and extremely happy. We chatted with her a bit and offered her some of our snacks. She eventually accepted one gummy bear. I think she was training for some sort of trail running race later in the fall.

By the evening we were just below Blackhead, on the Batavia Kill trail. We made camp there. The wet morning made it very hard for us to get a fire going. We kept failing. Looking around, we saw that every other group had a roaring fire. Eventually Gabe worked up the courage to ask someone what their fire magic was. They handed him a fire starter. I still remember watching every stick steam for ten minutes before it would catch fire!

The campsite was quite beautiful in the morning, with rays of light shining down through the forest. I was smitten enough that I [posted this view] on Instagram that morning:

We made our way up to the summit of Blackhead:

It's a bit of a mystery to me how we ended this hike. This is my last photo from the hike. Possibly my phone ran out of batteries? Blackhead summit is quite far from where we would have left our car by Windham. Gabe and Max don't have photos or tracks of their own. Maybe Max's dad came to pick us up in a different car? Did we do another high peak?

I was in Brooklyn hanging out w/ Melissa by 10pm on 8/7.
Maybe there's more information in text messages?
My messages with Melissa G on my current iPhone only go back to the end of 2016, not the start.
Maybe there's more in the Messages app on my old laptop?
