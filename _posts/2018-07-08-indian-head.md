We hit this up on the way back from Bovina (we'd do this [many more] [times] in the future). I'd been to Plattekill falls once before with my friend Richard during a rest day on a climbing trip and wanted to show it to Alex.

I guess we added a hike while we were there. I have almost no memory of the hike, though I do certainly remember jumping in the waterfall afterwards! It looks like it was peak summer.

This was my first Catskills hike in almost two years. What happened? I was traveling a lot to other places and prioritizing rock climbing over hiking. That would continue for the next few years.

From looking at my track, we may have stopped at the viewpoint rather than the true summit of Indian Head. Fortunately I hiked it [again in 2022].

<!--

The track for this hike from Moves has lots of data but is a bit tough to work with. I wound up just using it to get a start time and relied on photos for the other times to match the pattern from other hikes more closely. There's definitely more raw data in the track if I want it, though!
