<!-- excerpt -->

After hiking the Long Trail to [Mt Pisgah][pisgah] last weekend, I was curious what the trail was like in the other direction. No views (at least not when there are leaves on the trees) but some lovely fern groves and steep climbs. There was a vehicle trail that I thought might go up to the top of Mt Nebo but it petered out into another fern grove. _(Note from Dan in 2023: nowadays I would have just bushwhacked it!)_

Not a spectacular section of the Long Trail, but nice if you want to avoid crowds during a pandemic.
