Alex & I did this via Rider Hollow trailhead on our way to Andes, NY for a special picnic dinner at [Brushland Eating House]. This [wouldn't be the last time][bearpen-vly] I used a trip to Brushland as an excuse to drop by a trailhead!

I had no idea at the time that Balsam was one of the 3500 Club's four required winter peaks (the others being Panther, Slide and Blackhead). But it was fortuitous that I'd already done it when I started aiming to join the club in 2022. It meant I only had to hike Balsam once instead of twice.

Another memory of this hike is that we had to get back home for my 7pm online Spanish class with the [Berges institute], where I was giving a presentation _en espa√±ol_ about Colombian singer [Carlos Vives]. Alex helped me practice on the hike and at the picnic.
