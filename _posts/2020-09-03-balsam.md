Alex & I did this via Rider Hollow trailhead on our way to Andes, NY. This [wouldn't be the last time][bearpen-vly] I used a trip to Andes as an excuse to drop by a trailhead.

I had no idea at the time that Balsam was one of the 3500 Club's four required winter peaks (the others being Panther, Slide and Blackhead). But it was fortuitous that I'd already done it when I started aiming to join the club in 2022. It meant I only had to hike Balsam once instead of twice.
