Timeline:

- 1:05 PM Start hiking
- 3:05 PM Summit Black Dome
- 4:15 PM Back at the car

We'd hoped to see fall colors on this hike, but it was an incredibly foggy day and there was no visibility at the summit.

I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd done this hike with Max before. This turned out to be part true! I'd [hiked Blackhead] with Max four years earlier. The terrain is similarly steep in both directions.
