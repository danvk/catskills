<!-- excerpt -->

Alex, John G and I hiked Table and Peekamoose. This was our first hike with John. The birding was spectacular -- we heard thrushes and winter wrens throughout the hike and saw at least ten Blackburnian Warblers, including a family!

Alex got some great photos. There were so many Blackburnian warblers that eBird thought our checklist was suspicious. Not so!

Another fun natural discovery on this hike was "dog vomit slime mold". We've learned that slime molds often have fun names.

I always love the short, scruffy woods on ridgetops.

After a long hike, the views from Peekamoose were spectacular.

This was our first visit to the Denning St parking lot. I think I chose it because it was relatively close to our house compared to many of the other trailheads. It was a cool place to start a hike â€” I'd go there again! We saw monarch butterflies and heard Magnolia warblers.

This was definitely peak summer! So much green.
