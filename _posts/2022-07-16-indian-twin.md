<!-- excerpt -->

Did a loop with Alex. I found out later that I'd done Twin years ago with Max, so I somewhat regret pushing Alex to go to the summit over her protests about doing two peaks in one trip. I wanted to check out the Jimmy Dolan Notch viewpoint on our way down, but Alex wanted to head down. Bird highlights on this hike included finding a Junco nest with young in a rock face and seeing our first Blackpoll warbler.
