Hiked w/ Alex & John; we started around 11:20 AM. John was late and we started without him, but figured he'd catch up. Correct! We're slow.

Not as much of a Bushwack as expected at the top, more of a narrow path with a few rock scrambles. There was a surprise viewpoint at the top.

The plane wreckage was pretty incredible to see. Such a shocking thing to find in the woods.

We thought about walking down from Hurricane Ledge but thought the snowmobile loop would be long and not that interesting. In retrospect there's a herd path marked on some hiking maps that cuts back down to the main trail, andâ€¦ it goes past another plane wreck! I'd like to come back here another time to see Huckleberry Point and Poet's Ledge, not to mention the waterfall.
