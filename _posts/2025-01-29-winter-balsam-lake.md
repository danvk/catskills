To stay on track for my goal of completing my winter peaks this season, I wanted to do two hikes in January, 2-3 in February and 2-3 in March. With January nearly over and only [one hike] in the books, I was eager to get back out on the trails!

Balsam Lake has always felt like a "check the boxes" hike to me. It's a long drive, it's not a particularly long hike, and it was [one of the last] that I did on my 3500 list. A friend recently told me that you could hike to Balsam Lake from the north, rather than the usual, shorter route from the south. I figured that would make for a nice variation, and it would help me fill out my "all trails" map for the Catskills should that ever become a goal.

For the long drive up and back, I started listening to the recent Hardcore History podcast about Alexander the Great: [Mania for Subjugation]. Clocking in at nearly eight hours, it would certainly last the whole trip. Alexander's father, [Philip the II of Macedon], and his mother, [Olympias] are both fascinating characters in their own right.

The forecast wasn't amazing: cloudy, some light snow, and 50mph winds. It was perfectly sunny and clear when I left home, but it got cloudier as I drove north and, as I passed Belleayre, it started snowing lightly. I was certainly in the minority going for a hike today rather than skiing! There were no 50mph winds to be seen.

There was one other car in the Dry Brook lot when I arrived. It was a couple who was just starting the hike. I thought I might have company, but they explained they were having a "snowshoe issue" and weren't sure if they'd do the hike. I put on my snowshoes, crossed the road, and started up the hill.

I hadn't done a solo hike since [last April] and quickly found myself moving much too fast. I had to remind myself to maintain a steady pace, that it was better not to get too sweaty on cold days like these.

I was surprised that there weren't clearer tracks to follow. In places there was a "channel" but never clear snowshoe prints. There were usually only 1-3in of snow in the channel, but in places it felt like I was really breaking a track in 1-2ft of snow.

I made myself take a break every hour to pull water out of my backpack. I was generally pretty happy with my pace on the way up, and I enjoyed the snow and occasional views.

While it wasn't windy on the way up, there clearly _had_ been a lot of wind in the past. There were some interesting formation.

![Snowman on the path]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-01-29-winter-balsam-lake/IMG_8622-snowman-path.jpeg)

And I saw some interesting tracks:

![Snowshoe hare tracks]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-01-29-winter-balsam-lake/IMG_8623-tracks.jpeg)

Given the size, I wondered if they might be bear tracks. But they were single file. Steve from the [Catskills Facebook group] later [told me] they were [Snowshoe Hare] tracks. Cool!

As I got closer to the summit I joined up with the red trail. I'd wondered if there might be tracks here at least, but it was still totally blank. This part was quite steep and I had to take more frequent breaks.

Towards the summit the canopy got lower and I realy started to feel like I was in a snow globe.

I knew there was a fire tower at the summit, but still, it was pretty jarring to see a man-made structure so high up after such a long walk through the woods!

![Fire tower]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-01-29-winter-balsam-lake/IMG_8634-fire-tower.jpeg)

I'd hoped for a view from the fire tower. I took off my snowshoes and started ascending, but that was when the weather started to change. Snow started falling and I found the 50mph winds once I was above the trees. There was no point in continuing up.

These two photos were taken literally one minute apart.

I tried to eat my sandwich just in the woods, where I'd hoped I would be more sheltered from the wind and snow, but this was clearly not the place to be. I started making a hasty descent.

For a moment near the top, I got worried about visibility. It was very hard or impossible to see my tracks from just 30 minutes earlier. Now it was clear why I hadn't seen any tracks on this hike: the wind gusts would fill them in almost immediately!

![Poor visibility on the way down]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-01-29-winter-balsam-lake/IMG_8637-poor-visibility.jpeg)

When I got back down to the red trail junction, I realized that the visibility issue was more my glasses fogging and icing over. The conditions weren't all that bad. So I hiked down without glasses and felt much better.

![Light snow at the end]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-01-29-winter-balsam-lake/IMG_8640-snow-end.jpeg)

There were lots of wind gusts on the way down but otherwise the descent was uneventful. I noticed that the other couple had signed in after me at the register and also signed out. I never saw them so they must have given up.

Five hikes left for my Winter 3500!
