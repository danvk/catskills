- Third time up Halcott
- Three goals for this hike: Winter Halcott, Sleeping Lion, the star on the Avenza map.
- Most Sleeping Lion tracks go clockwise, but I thought CCW made more sense.
- Finished Mania for Subjugation II on the way up. It felt warm.
- Started in spikes, quickly switched. Some uncertainty about which track to follow. Worth it to take time to decide!
- Some tracks towards Sleeping Lion, but they quickly stopped making sense and I realized I was following hare tracks.
- The ascent was steep and I was on fresh snow. Between conditions and hard work, I was quickly down to a sweater and no gloves. I thought about going down to a T-shirt.
- Definitely didn't make good time up Sleeping Lion but that was OK! I stopped frequently for water and to get my heart rate down.
- Most tracks veered north, so I did the same. I don't think it mattered.
- Some other tracks at the top -- where did those come from!?!? Thought I saw the summit cairn buried under snow.
- No tracks heading towards Halcott.
