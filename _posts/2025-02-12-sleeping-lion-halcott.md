Timeline:

- 10:30 AM Start hiking
- 12:20 PM Summit Sleeping Lion
- 2:05 PM Summit Halcott
- 3:20 PM Back at the car

- Tracks: [AllTrails]
- Conditions: 20s, partial sun, 18-24 inches of snow higher up

- Third time up Halcott
- Three goals for this hike: Winter Halcott, Sleeping Lion, the star on the Avenza map.
- Most Sleeping Lion tracks go clockwise, but I thought CCW made more sense.
- Finished Mania for Subjugation II on the way up. It felt warm.
- Started in spikes, quickly switched. Some uncertainty about which track to follow. Worth it to take time to decide!
- Some tracks towards Sleeping Lion, but they quickly stopped making sense and I realized I was following hare tracks.
- The ascent was steep and I was on fresh snow. Between conditions and hard work, I was quickly down to a sweater and no gloves. I thought about going down to a T-shirt. Rule of up. But nice to be making progress towards a goal. No nettles today!
- Definitely didn't make good time up Sleeping Lion but that was OK! I stopped frequently for water and to get my heart rate down.
- Most tracks veered north, so I did the same. I don't think it mattered.
- Some other tracks at the top -- where did those come from!?!? Thought I saw the summit cairn buried under snow.
- No tracks heading towards Halcott, darn!
- Nice sense of space. I was relieved that it wasn't windy. Put my jacket and glove liners on around here. Go down, but not down anything steep.
- It was slow going here because the snow was so deep. Real quad/hamstring workout.
- At some point I worked back towards the left and found a faint set of snowshoe prints with some animal tracks on top of them. This made an enormous amount of difference. Felt like I had a spring in my step. Even if I didn't love the path, I only had to take one step out of it to be reminded how helpful it was. The animal tracks made it very easy to follow, and they tracked it for almost a mile before going in a different direction before the final ascent to Halcott.
- Kept following the snowshoe prints. I couldn't tell if it was gray clouds or more snow past the next ridgeâ€¦ but then there was the canister!
- First person to sign in today. For the first and only of the hike, I felt a little cold.
- To check out the star? I'm here, may as well. I started down the herd path for an easy descent, and so that I could follow my own tracks back. It was a 15-20 minute detour. There was a partial view of Belleayre. If there was a full view somewhere, I missed it.
- Descent was very fast. Ran into one other hiker working on her grid and winter solo hikes. That's not one I've tracked!
- A few inconsequential forks in the road.
- Was sad to see some of the Hemlocks either dead or dying.
- Phoenicia Diner was closed, so I got my celebratory milkshake at Stewart's Shops instead.
- All in all: harder than expected but great conditions. 28/33!
