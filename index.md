This site chronicles my hiking in New York's Catskills Mountains and my progress towards joining the [Catskills 3500 Club][club]. I was inspired to do this by the [NJ/NY Hikes][njny] blog, which I found very helpful in planning my hikes. Hopefully you'll find this blog helpful, too!

Check out the posts below for individual hikes, or this nifty interactive map view:
